# ![Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/webscripts/logo60s2.gif) Unilex

Unilex is a machine-readable list of words.  For every word in every
language, we’d like to collect [properties](PROPERTIES.md) such as
word frequency,
pronunciation, hyphenation, part of speech, or grammatical
information.  The [Unicode Consortium](http://www.unicode.org/)
releases this data under the same
[license](http://unicode.org/copyright.html#License)
as all its other data files. We hope you’ll find this data useful for
building spell checkers, text-to-speech synthesis systems, or similar
language-processing software.

This project has just started, so you’ll see that the current coverage
is quite minimal. To bring the project out of its “vaporware” state,
we’d love to work with you! Please do
[tell us](https://github.com/unicode-org/unilex/issues) if you
can contribute lexical data for a language.

Eventually, we plan releasing lexical data for the world’s languages
as part of the
[Unicode Common Locale Data Repository](http://cldr.unicode.org/).
 The final format has has not been decided yet: one option could be to
format everything into XML files according to the [Lexical Markup
Framework](http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org/); or we might define
some new, possibly JSON-based format; or maybe we’ll just publish the
data in its present form of tab-separated plaintext files.
